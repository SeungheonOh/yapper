# Yapper

![Demo Vid](assets/demo.mp4)

Welcome to my project, **Yapper**! It's a super simple speech-to-text application, so that's why it's a little derpy lol. The project is just a 200-line Python script written by me (per se, wink wink). Most of the code was actually generated by ChatGPT. Its pretty much a GTK wrapper for [openai-whisper-cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)

## Description

The idea behind Yapper is simple: I wanted to click a button, speak into my microphone, and have everything transcribed automatically using GPT's Whisper model. It works fairly well, though it's a bit slow, so donâ€™t expect too much. If there are bugs, I probably canâ€™t fix them right away, but I will patch any that I run into personally. 

Hereâ€™s the flow:
1. Speak into the microphone.
2. Get a rough transcription (think of it as a research paper or whatever).
3. Throw it into ChatGPT to refine it, and ChatGPT will clean things up, add punctuation, and make it more legible.

In the end, you have your thoughts and ideasâ€”just dictated instead of typed out for hours while smashing your head against the desk.

## Features

- Speech-to-text transcription using Whisper
- Use ChatGPT to refine your transcriptions
- Works (kind of) but donâ€™t expect much support!

## Installation

Since Iâ€™m on NixOS, Iâ€™ll leave a guide for how to install this on NixOS here. If you want to style it like mine, Iâ€™ve set it up with the Catppuccin theme. Iâ€™ll figure out how to share that too.

## Contributing

Donâ€™t expect much support, but if you have cool ideas, feel free to open a pull request. I am open to contributions and excited to see if anyone actually contributes to this project. If you do, feel free to give it a star! ðŸ˜„

Note: I didnâ€™t write all of this myself, I just needed a quick solution, and all the other ones out there werenâ€™t quite right.

## Testing
first clone the repo
- add instructions
then make sure to have python 3.12 installed with your distros package manager or [their website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)

- add instructions
go install [openai-whisper-cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) then run
```bash
whisper-cpp-download-ggml-model base.en
```
This will download the model to your machine in the current dir that the command was run
```bash
python yapper.py
```
